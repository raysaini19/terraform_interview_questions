1. Scenario: Managing Multiple Environments

Question: How would you manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) with Terraform, ensuring that each environment has isolated resources and state? 

Answer: Use separate workspaces or directories for each environment. Store the state files in different locations (e.g., separate S3 buckets) and use terraform workspace select <env> to switch between environments. Alternatively, use a backend block with dynamic configuration to point to different state files.

```
```

2. Scenario: Handling Secrets in Terraform

Question: How would you securely manage sensitive information like API keys or passwords in your Terraform configuration? 

Answer: Use Terraform's sensitive flag to mark outputs as sensitive and store secrets in encrypted storage like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault. Reference these secrets using data sources in Terraform.

```
```
3. Scenario: Terraform State Locking

Question: What would you do if Terraform’s state locking fails when using a remote backend like S3? 

Answer: First, check for any existing locks using the terraform state list command. If a lock exists but shouldn’t, you can use the force-unlock command: terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>. This will remove the lock manually.

```
```
4. Scenario: Module Reusability

Question: How would you design a reusable module to provision an AWS VPC that can be used across multiple projects with varying requirements? 

Answer: Create a module with variables for configurable attributes like CIDR blocks, subnets, and tags. Use default values for common settings but allow override through variables. Use outputs to expose important information like VPC ID and subnet IDs.

```
```
5. Scenario: Terraform Drift Detection

Question: How do you handle configuration drift if someone changes the resources directly in the cloud provider’s console? 

Answer: Run terraform plan regularly to detect drift. Terraform will compare the state with the actual resources. To reconcile drift, use terraform apply to bring resources back to the desired state or terraform refresh to update the state file.

```
```
6. Scenario: Conditional Resource Creation

Question: How would you conditionally create resources, such as an S3 bucket, only if a certain variable is true? 

Answer: Use the count or for_each meta-arguments with conditional logic. For example:

```
```
7. Scenario: Large Terraform State Files

Question: What approach would you take if your Terraform state file becomes too large and slow to manage? 

Answer: Break down your configuration into smaller, more manageable modules with separate state files. Use terraform_remote_state to reference outputs between states.

```
```
8. Scenario: Terraform and CICD

Question: How would you integrate Terraform with a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy infrastructure changes? 

Answer: Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply steps. Ensure you’re using a remote backend for state and manage secrets securely using environment variables or secret management tools.


```
```
9. Scenario: Terraform Imports

Question: You need to import an existing AWS resource into your Terraform state. How would you do this? 

Answer: Use the terraform import command to map the existing resource to the Terraform configuration. After importing, update the Terraform configuration file to match the imported resource.

```
```

10. Scenario: Dependency Management

Question: How do you manage complex dependencies between resources in Terraform? 

Answer: Use depends_on to explicitly define dependencies when needed. Terraform automatically handles dependencies based on references, but for complex scenarios, depends_on ensures proper ordering.

```
```

11. Scenario: Multi-Cloud Deployments

Question: How would you deploy infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using Terraform? 

Answer: Create separate provider configurations for each cloud provider. Use modules to encapsulate the infrastructure for each provider and manage the deployment through a central root module.

```
```

12. Scenario: Terraform Rollbacks

Question: How would you handle a failed Terraform deployment that leaves resources in an inconsistent state? 

Answer: Review the Terraform state and the terraform plan output. To rollback, restore the state from a backup or manually fix the inconsistent resources in the cloud console and then refresh the state with terraform refresh.

```
```
13. Scenario: Data Source Dependencies

Question: How would you handle a scenario where a Terraform data source depends on a resource being created in the same configuration? 

Answer: Use depends_on to force the data source to wait until the resource is created. Alternatively, structure the code so that the resource creation and data source fetching are handled in separate steps or modules.


```
```
14. Scenario: Managing Provider Versions

Question: How do you ensure that all team members use the same provider version in their Terraform configurations? 

Answer: Specify the provider version explicitly in the required_providers block. Use version constraints to ensure consistency across environments.

```
```


```
```


```
